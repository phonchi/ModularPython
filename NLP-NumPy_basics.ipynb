Your model can often be improved if you don’t take those words into account. Stop words are just a list of words you don’t want to use as features. You can set the parameter stop_words=’english’ to use a built-in list. Alternatively you can set stop_words equal to some custom list. This parameter defaults to None.\n","\n","**ngram_range**: An n-gram is just a string of n words in a row. E.g. the sentence ‘I am Groot’ contains the 2-grams ‘I am’ and ‘am Groot’. The sentence is itself a 3-gram. Set the parameter ngram_range=(a,b) where a is the minimum and b is the maximum size of ngrams you want to include in your features. The default ngram_range is (1,1). In a recent project where I modeled job postings online, I found that including 2-grams as features boosted my model’s predictive power significantly. This makes intuitive sense; many job titles such as ‘data scientist’, ‘data engineer’, and ‘data analyst’ are 2 words long.\n","\n","**min_df, max_df**: These are the minimum and maximum document frequencies words/n-grams must have to be used as features. If either of these parameters are set to integers, they will be used as bounds on the number of documents each feature must be in to be considered as a feature. If either is set to a float, that number will be interpreted as a frequency rather than a numerical limit. min_df defaults to 1 (int) and max_df defaults to 1.0 (float).\n","\n","**max_features**: This parameter is pretty self-explanatory.
