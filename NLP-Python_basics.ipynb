Essentially, it measures how much the actual co-occurrence of $x$ and $y$ deviates from what would be expected if they were independent. The logarithm base 2 transforms the ratio such that:\n","- A ratio of 1 (indicating independence) is mapped to 0.\n","- A ratio greater than 1 (indicating positive association) is mapped to a positive value.\n","- A ratio less than 1 (indicating negative association) is mapped to a negative value.\n","\n","**Interpretation**:\n","- **Zero PMI** indicates that the events $x$ and $y$ are **independent**. For example, the words \"city\" and \"full\" typically do not depend on each other.\n","- **Positive PMI** suggests that the events are more likely to occur together than independently. For example, \"New\" and \"York\" often appear together and thus have a positive PMI.\n","- **Negative PMI** implies that the occurrence of one event reduces the likelihood of the other occurring, suggesting a negative association.
